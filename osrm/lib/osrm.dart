/// This file contains the full SDK for Project-OSRM in Dart.
///
/// To use this SDK, you will need to import this file into your Dart project.
///
/// Here are the steps to use this SDK:
///
/// 1. Import this file into your Dart project:
///
///    ```dart
///    import 'path/to/osrm.dart';
///    ```
///
/// 2. Create an instance of the `OSRM` class:
///
///    ```dart
///    final osrm = Osrm();
///    // you can set extra options example:
///    final _osrm = Osrm(
///       source: OsrmSource(
///         ///...
///       ),
///    );
///    ```
///
///    Replace `http://localhost:5000` with the URL of your OSRM server.
///
/// 3. Use the `OSRM` instance to make requests to the OSRM server:
///
///    ```dart
///    final route = await osrm.route(
///      waypoints: [
///        Waypoint(location: Location(latitude: 52.5160, longitude: 13.3779)),
///        Waypoint(location: Location(latitude: 52.5206, longitude: 13.3862)),
///      ],
///      steps: true,
///      // other parameters
///    );
///    ```
///
///    This example makes a request to the OSRM server to calculate a route between two waypoints.
///
///    The `route` variable will contain a `Route` object that represents the calculated route.
///
///    You can customize the request by passing additional parameters to the `route` method.
///
///    For more information on the available parameters, see the documentation for the `OSRM` class.
///
/// This SDK follows best practices for Dart development, including the use of asynchronous methods and the `dart:io` library for making HTTP requests.

  /// Finds the fastest route between coordinates in the supplied order.

  /// - alternatives: search for alternative routes and return as well
  /// - steps: return route steps for each route leg
